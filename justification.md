# Water Quality Monitoring in Mexico

## Project Justification
Clean water is a fundamental resource for public health, agriculture, and the preservation of ecosystems in Mexico. This project analyzes data from 4,676 monitoring sites managed by the National Water Commission (CONAGUA) to identify contaminated water bodies that pose a risk to communities. By processing and visualizing this data through an automated ETL pipeline, critical areas requiring urgent intervention can be easily identified, allowing state and federal governments to prioritize resource allocation for sanitation programs and the construction of treatment plants. The primary beneficiaries are rural communities that rely on these water bodies for consumption and agriculture, governments that can make informed decisions on water infrastructure investments, environmental organizations that need up-to-date data for conservation programs, and economic sectors such as agriculture and tourism that depend on quality water for sustainable operations.
